# Gmail AI Unsubscriber v1.0.0

**Take back your inbox. One unsubscribe at a time.**

This is the initial public release of Gmail AI Unsubscriber - a local Python application that helps you automatically unsubscribe from unwanted emails with AI-powered insights and browser automation.

## 🎉 What's Included

### 🤖 AI-Powered Features
- **Brutally Honest Hot Takes** - GPT-4o-mini generates one-sentence summaries of what each sender actually sends you
- **Smart Reading Pattern Analysis** - Analyzes your last 90 days to identify subscriptions you never read
- **Personalized Recommendations** - Optional user profile for tailored suggestions

### ✂️ Unsubscribe Automation
- **Interactive "Keep or Cut" CLI** - Fun swipe-style interface (💚 keep | 🔪 cut)
- **Automated Browser Agent** - Playwright handles complex unsubscribe flows
- **Auto-Archive** - Emails automatically archived after unsubscribing
- **Effectiveness Tracking** - Monitor if senders actually stop emailing you

### 📊 Smart Modes
- `--suggest` - Analyze reading patterns and suggest worst offenders (default)
- `--daily` - One subscription suggestion per day (perfect for cron jobs)
- `--aggressive` - Bulk unsubscribe from low-engagement senders
- `--chief-of-staff` - Goal-aligned inbox intelligence report

### 🔐 Privacy & Security
- Runs entirely locally on your machine
- OAuth authentication (no API keys in code)
- No data leaves your computer (except Gmail API + optional OpenAI API)
- All sensitive files in .gitignore

## 🚀 Quick Start
